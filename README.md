## Editaable Mode - Requeriments
* Pressing the key combination cmd + k (on mac) or ctrl + k (windows) should be able to edit the texts on the page.
* While the page is in edit mode, an options bar should appear at the top where the save changes button will be.
* While the page is in edit mode, the texts that I can edit must be visually identifiable.
* Once the changes are saved, when reloading the page the changes must persist locally.

## Work flow
